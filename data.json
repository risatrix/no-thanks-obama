Her lesbian status will be announced shortly after she is sworn in. The new first lady will not be Bill, but Hillary's 'beard', whoever she, excuse me, sorry, it, is. Trump is propped up as the last gasp of white America. The party will reject him as too radical & he will take his votes with him to form a new party. Just like Ross Perot, Teddy Roosevelt, etc., etc., (The public falls for it every time.) Bush will drop out so as to not embarass the family any further. The party will pick someone totally unelectable as is par for the course. (ala not born in the U.S. McCain, a walking corpse with zero personality with a ditz running mate or Romney.) Or they could try to appease the mestizos & run Rubio or they may possibly even run Ted Cruz who was born a Canadian who had to renounce that citizenship since only one parent was an American. Solely to mock the constitution further. Oh, does anyone even know all references to the POTUS in the constitution are all masculine? (Are you even smart enough to catch what I just said?) Maybe Hillary has a penis that we are unaware of? I am sure the current purported first lady has one. It is even probable that Obozo hasn't one. Or possibly even any balls to go with it.\n\nFrom then on all of your children will be taught Spanish & English will be dropped from the schools. It may remain bastardized as an elective as a ghetto language for purposes of what is called 'rap music'. You see, as goes California, so goes the rest of the country. The last gasp of white America in Californication was about 15 years ago. Now its your turn to suffer the consequences of ignoring people who have been trying to warn you for the last century. It's your turn to suffer for sitting on your asses all of your life. Say bye to your country white America. You deserve whatever is coming.\n\nYou can bet that K-Y Jelly and all petroleum jelly products will be intentionally taken off the market at the end of next October.\n\nOh, well ... you will never get the smell out of the White House anyway.\n\nSolution? All good white folks move to Texas. We'll be leaving the union.","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153609324290837?comment_id=10153611625245837","user":{"name":"David H Sandlin","id":"10203669053544715"},"likes":0},{"id":"10153608715300837_10153608879465837","text":"Josh Gravens","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153608715300837?comment_id=10153608879465837","user":{"name":"Jacqueline Espinal","id":"10203853866600017"},"likes":1},{"id":"10153608715300837_10153608889395837","text":"That scenario is preposterous, first state law prohibits all of those.

Case participants were also more likely to be located in areas with less income and more illicit drug trafficking.”\n\nThat hardly sounds representative of Texas concealed handgun license (CHL) holders, who cannot have had Class A or B misdemeanor conviction within the past five years, who can never have had a felony conviction or any level of family violence conviction, who cannot have a history of chemical dependence, and who are approximately 1/5 as likely to be convicted of a violent crime and less than 1/10 as likely to be convicted of a nonviolent crime, compared to the general population.\n\nBasically, the study found that people engaging in criminal activity, working in high-risk professions, or hanging out in dangerous neighborhoods are more likely to carry a gun and more likely to be shot. This leads us to wonder if these same researchers did a follow-up study in which they found that people who carry insulin injectors are more likely to suffer from diabetes.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that the study counted individuals who had a firearm in a nearby vehicle or building as being in \"possession\" of a gun. How does a gun locked away in one's car or apartment increase one's chances of being shot on the street?","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153604958695837?comment_id=10153605036250837","user":{"category":"Non-Profit Organization","name":"Students for Concealed Carry","id":"249954622621"},"likes":4},{"id":"10153604958695837_10153605169245837","text":"Well said, Catherine, cue the crazies in 3, 2, . . .","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153604958695837?comment_id=10153605169245837","user":{"name":"Bob Warneke","id":"10203441824105581"},"likes":0},{"id":"10153604958695837_10153605234740837","text":"Myth #7: Guns make women safer.\nFact-check: In 2010, nearly 6 times more women were shot by husbands, boyfriends, and ex-partners than murdered by male strangers.\n• A woman's chances of being killed by her abuser increase more than 5 times if he has access to a gun.\n• One study found that women in states with higher gun ownership rates were 4.9 timesmore likely to be murdered by a gun than women in states with lower gun ownership rates.","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153604958695837?comment_id=10153605234740837","user":{"name":"Marty Jamieson","id":"4270518299120"},"likes":1},{"id":"10153604958695837_10153605244310837","text":"I don't support campus carry.

I'd rather see every district become competitive and 8 years, at least 8 consecutive years, be the limit for anyone.  I'm not so naive as to think that legislating isn't essentially a skilled trade, and that voters don't benefit from experienced candidates, but that's what the State legislatures and Senates and City Councils are for.  \n\nTo the author's point, 2 years is probably not enough time to get really good at legislating in D.C. if you haven't done it before even at the state level, but that's just Hurd and Canseco. Gallego spent his share of time in the TX legislature and Rodriguez and Bonilla were in the US legislature for long enough to know what they were doing. \n\nI also agree that the article lacked any concrete details about what exactly they think these congressmen failed to achieve for voters that a long-term incumbent could have. They also fail to indicate why this district is so elusive. What about the shape and makeup of this district is responsible for this phenomenon, or is it that the people replaced after two years apiece  weren't doing a good job? Is the district split right down the middle with party loyalist voters based on its boundaries? \n\nI honestly don't know the answers to those questions because neither is addressed in the article, but would expect at least cursory analysis in an article that makes the conclusion that it's the \"insidious\" design of the district that is causing it right in the title of the article, as if the candidates' performance couldn't possibly have anything to do with their term tenure. Am I to infer that the author thinks that incumbency is something we should expect without regard to the candidate's performance? If it is the design, how did redistricting cause this and why would anyone have made this district so difficult to win? Those sound like the elements of a real story. I don't really care about job security for legislators or what's a \"pain in the butt for politicos\". \n\n100% incumbency rates give you people Sheldon Silver was in the NY Assembly. Think about what his durable political power got his constituents and what it cost the rest of that state's citizens! This article proposes solving the wrong problem. The problem is that other districts' representatives have too much stability and that gives them time to become entrenched. \n\nI get that it takes more than 2 years to accomplish anything big, but maybe that's the idea.

Our horse is in training many hundreds of miles away in America, many states away. We only get to experience the thrill of owning a winning Texas-bred racehorse through an occasional digital photo sent from our trainer then shared on FB with other fans of Texas racing. Our horse has visited more places in the span of the last year, than we have in decades. We didn't get to stand in the winner's circle with her during her last win. We watched her on TV, being unable to travel across country and afford a hefty training bill, plus the costs of caring for our other horses including two new foals and a pregnant mare. Why? Because even when you win, when you race in Texas, you loose. You end up in the red. We along with an ever increasing number of our fellow Texas horse owners and trainers have come to the conclusion that we must race out of state if we are going to have the opportunity to make racing economically feasible. All because of the dismal state of Texas racing. \n\nBy adopting the rules for Historical Racing, the Texas Racing Commission moved to improve Texas racing not only for small owner-breeders like ourselves, but to help everyone associated with the industry from the fan, the mgr. and employee of the local feed store, the groom at the local training facility (who has held his job for 30 yrs., by the way), to the owner of what was once one of the state's most magnificent stallion farms a few miles down the road, and many more...Unfortunately, Texas horsemen have become a pawn in a legislative power play by certain members of the Legislative Budget Board. \"Texas horsemen\", \"horsemen\", \"the industry\", whatever term used to describe the men and women who rely, and care about the  success or failure of this industry, are just that--we are real people, with real lives. Like so many others who are involved in racing, we work hard to be able to have our horses and have sacrificed much be a part of it. The failure of the Texas Legislative Budget Board to approve immediate full funding for the Texas Racing Commission leaves us asking ourselves from the owner-breeder perspective if we will be able to continue in the sport we love. We are left  wondering, \"Will we be able to breed our mare again? Will will be able to afford to breed at all if forced to breed out of state? Will we ever see our Texas-bred babies race in Texas? Can  we afford to race out of state for the duration of the horse's career? Do we even care to if we must continue in the role of absentee owners who live hundreds of miles away, unable to experience the thrill of visiting our horse at the track and standing together in the winner's circle?\"\n\nNot fun and sad.

This was the dumbest proposal Mayor Parker has ever engaged with voters during her two terms. As a Gay Mayor of Liberal Houston, perhaps she forgot we're still located well within the Bible Belt? To clearly a plurality of Houston residents--- Gay and Straight, it looked as if she was  promoting that which conservative evangelicals within Houston and nationwide have long alleged against openly Gay politicians: the mayor was promoting a Gay Agenda. As a somewhat conservative Gay-American, I instantly perceived her motivations for forcing such a radical and insensitive proposal on Houstonians  were inspired \"subjectively\" rather than \"objectively.\" Relative to her proposal, she even went after local clergy earlier this year attempting to force them into submitting the text of any sermons which they argued against her HERO proposal? Again, moves like that drew opposition from even Houston's Gay community. Alas a coalition of white local Republican religious leaders and Democratic black clergy--- those even more conservative than Republicans, and Gay residents \"dropped the bomb\" on this absurd travesty-in-the making. Again, I myself--- a proudly Gay-American, voted against this bill.

As a result of today's election, Houston is now the largest city in the United States WITHOUT these local protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people, women, minorities, veterans, and many others.\n\nIt's almost unbelievable that this could happen in a vibrant and diverse city like Houston. And make no mistake: if we don't double down on our commitment to equality today, we'll face the same thing again and again in cities across the nation.\n\nAs you well know by now, the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO) passed the City Council with the support of HRC and our pro-equality allies last year, before being forced onto the ballot by the all-elected Texas Supreme Court. Then, over the last few weeks, our opponents shamelessly spread misinformation and ugly lies about LGBT people in an effort to trick fair-minded voters into voting against HERO.\n\nAlongside the ACLU, NAACP, Equality Texas, and our local and national partners as well as with local businesses and faith leaders, we formed Houston Unites to push back on the lies and attack ads. Together – thanks to thousands of supporters like you – we were able to launch an unprecedented deployment of staff and resources to Houston to support the coalition's effort.\n\nOver the last several months, across Houston and across Texas, our supporters and allies stepped up like never before. I've witnessed the grit and determination firsthand as you've made phone calls, knocked on doors, talked to friends and neighbors about why HERO matters, and volunteered countless hours because you understood why nondiscrimination protections are needed in Houston.\n\nToday is a no doubt a setback for all of us. In the end, we fell short in getting enough votes that now mean the difference between 15 classes of Houstonians being vulnerable to discrimination instead of protections that help ensure they'll be treated equally under the law. But believe me when I say this fight isn't over.\n\nBecause of you, our members and supporters, we helped the coalition in Houston wage this crucial campaign with unprecedented strength. When we have faced attacks on equality, you've kept our work going.\n\nHere in Texas we are going to keep up the fight for equality. And we are not going to let tonight's loss in Houston set the tone for the upcoming year. We are counting on our faithful supporters like you to be there alongside us again for the tough battles ahead.\n\nThank you for everything you have done and continue to do,\n\n___________________\nMY TAKE:  While I agree with Chad in the main, I also believe the abysmal 25% voter turnout was the REAL reason we lost this fight.  We MUST do better, or we could lose the White House in 2016, no matter how high Hillary Clinton's poll numbers are!\n\nWhen Democrats VOTE, Democrats WIN! \n\nREGISTER TODAY!\nhttp://www.rockthevote.com/get-informed/elections/?referrer=https://www.facebook.com/","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153595445910837?comment_id=10153595544660837","user":{"name":"Brian Bowen","id":"1006907752658462"},"likes":2},{"id":"10153595445910837_10153595558495837","text":"Anyone old enough to remember bathroom fears tanking the ERA vote in several states?","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153595445910837?comment_id=10153595558495837","user":{"name":"Barbara Waite","id":"779461235398455"},"likes":1},{"id":"10153595445910837_10153595591585837","text":"#BoycottHouston","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153595445910837?comment_id=10153595591585837","user":{"name":"Justin Bryan Galloway","id":"461438683989782"},"likes":0},{"id":"10153595445910837_10153595593065837","text":"People of Houston, you disappoint me.","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153595445910837?comment_id=10153595593065837","likes":2},{"id":"10153595445910837_10153595903465837","text":"Patricia Martinez was on Houston","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153595445910837?comment_id=10153595903465837","user":{"name":"Sonia Morales","id":"10202649620220924"},"likes":0},{"id":"10153595445910837_10153596068585837","text":"You go Houston.

And I think he would be a great Vice President for Mrs Clinton. But he simply does not have the breadth and depth of experience on the global stage that Hillary Clinton brings to the table on day one.\n\nJust a few of HILLARY CLINTON’s ACCOMPLISHMENTS:\n\nSecured $40 Billion to restore New York City (virtually on a hand shake) after the 9/11 attacks, and repeatedly enforced strict accounting records to ensure the funds were used as intended\n\nRemained the biggest champion for first responders' medical treatment following their exposure to the toxic chemicals released in the unique combination of jet fuel and pummelled concrete\n\nRestored dignity to our US State Department and diplomatic corps, restoring thread bare relationships with world leaders around the globe \n\nTook full responsibility for failures in Benghazi, and was completely exonerated of any personal wrong doing \n\nVoluntarily presented the largest cache of email communications of any government leader to the State Department for release to the public, branding her as one of the most transparent leaders of any presidential administration in history\n\nWorked to advance human rights for women, children and LGBT people around the world with her historic speech to the Geneva Convention, following the lead of the Obama administration to make equal rights a vital component of national foreign policy issues\n\nSecured more than 18 million votes in her first run for the Presidency before conceding the Democratic nomination to President Obama \n\nEstablished early ideological and practical parameters to today's more concrete health care reform, and communicated them to Congress. She remains the only serving First Lady to testify before Congress on such a broad, national reform issue\n\nAnd then of course her most sterling qualification: \n\nShe is a MOTHER! :)\n________________________________________________\n\nSnapshot of Hillary Clinton's Record as Secretary of State \n\nAs Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton fought to make the world safer and to restore America's leadership in the world after it was badly eroded by eight years of the Bush administration's foreign policy. Her tenure is marked by significant accomplishments, from building a powerful global sanctions regime against Iran, to brokering a cease-fire in Gaza to protect Israel, to supporting President Obama in the raid against Osama Bin Laden, and much more.\n\nTake a look at some of her topline achievements below:\n\nShe led the effort to impose the toughest sanctions in history on Iran, twisting arms in China, Russia and dozens of other countries to force Iran to the negotiating table.\n\nShe personally negotiated a stop to Hamas rockets raining down on Israel with a cease-fire in Gaza and actively supported Israel's Iron Dome rocket defense system, which saved the lives of many Israelis.\n\nShe was part of the President's team making the decision to launch the raid against Osama bin Laden.\n\nShe made women's rights, economic participation, and political participation central to American foreign policy and global affairs, which history will record as a profound contribution.\n\nShe worked to ensure the ratification of the New START treaty, which will make the world safer by reducing American and Russian nuclear arsenals to their lowest point in fifty years.\n\nShe put economics and energy at the heart of the State Department's agenda. Her jobs diplomacy efforts contributed to a 50 percent increase in American exports to China.\n\nShe worked to build an unprecedented global effort to combat climate change, joining President Obama to stand up to the Chinese in Copenhagen and get them to take greater responsibility for carbon emissions.\n\nShe made the rights of LGBT people a key focus of her efforts as Secretary of State, including lobbying intensively for the first ever U.N. Human Rights Council resolution on LGBT human rights.\n\nShe fought to expand internet freedom around the world, standing up to Russia, China, and Iran on the issue.\n\nHillary Clinton oversaw a staff of about 70,000 employees at nearly 270 diplomatic posts in 190 countries around the world.\nOverseeing a budget of more than $50 billion, Clinton worked hard to ensure that American taxpayers got the \"most bang for the buck\" with State and USAID programs during tough economic times.\n\n\"With less resources and new challenges\" Clinton promoted public-private partnerships, launching the Global Partnership Initiative to act as a convener, catalyst, and collaborator with the private sector.\n\nFormer Republican Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said Hillary Clinton \"ran the State Department in the most effective way that I've ever seen.\"\n\n________________________________________________\nAnd if that’s not enough, here’s a few more:\n\nYou don’t have to like Hillary Clinton or her ideas. I get it. She’s a Democrat, a progressive (in most eyes), and conservatives don’t like that. However, you cannot say she does not have any accomplishments. Here are just a few:\n\nEven though her major initiative, the Clinton healthcare plan, failed (due to Republican obstruction), you cannot deny that it laid ground for what we have today, the Affordable Healthcare Act, something Clinton supports and would continue.\n\nShe played a leading role in the development of State Children’s Health Insurance Program, which provides the much-needed state support for children whose parents cannot afford nor provide them with adequate healthcare coverage.\n\nShe was also instrumental in the creation of the Adoption and Safe Families Act and the Foster Care Independence Act.\n\nSuccessfully fought to increase research funding for prostate cancer and asthma at the National Institute of Health (NIH).\n\nShe spearheaded investigations into mental illness plaguing veterans of the Gulf War; we now have a term for it – Gulf War Syndrome.\n\nAt the Department of Justice, she helped create the office on Violence Against Women.\n\nShe was instrumental in securing over $21 billion in funding for the World Trade Center redevelopment.\n\nTook a leading role in the investigation of health consequences of first responders and drafted the first bill to compensate and offer the health services our first responders deserve (Clinton’s successor in the Senate, Kirsten Gillibrand, passed the bill).\n\nWas instrumental in working out a bi-partisan compromise to address civil liberty abuses for the renewal of the U.S. Patriot Act.\n\nProposed a revival of the New Deal-era Home Owners’ Loan Corporation to help homeowners refinance their mortgages in the wake of the 2008 financial disaster.\n\nWas a major proponent of sensible diplomacy which brought about a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, and brokered human rights with Burma.\n\nOversaw free trade agreements with our allies such as Panama, Colombia, and South Korea.\n\nWas the most traveled Secretary of State to date.\n\nThe Clinton Foundation, founded by her and her husband, has improved the living conditions for nearly 400 million people in over 180 countries through its Initiative program.","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153581839945837?comment_id=10153581884865837","user":{"name":"Brian Bowen","id":"1006907752658462"},"likes":7},{"id":"10153581839945837_10153581891125837","text":"Chester Gould couldn't have drawn more off-putting mugs.","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153581839945837?comment_id=10153581891125837","user":{"name":"Craig Dävis","id":"10203953837264667"},"likes":0},{"id":"10153581839945837_10153581908920837","text":"\"Well,folks,we're down to our final two contestants on\"Who can be the biggest Asshole\"Contest\",I can tell you,the competition is pretty stiff............\"","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153581839945837?comment_id=10153581908920837","user":{"name":"Terry Brooks","id":"10152818716576648"},"likes":3},{"id":"10153581839945837_10153582085570837","text":"CRUZ 2016","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153581839945837?comment_id=10153582085570837","user":{"name":"Dennis Carroll","id":"665348680187331"},"likes":0},{"id":"10153581839945837_10153582114095837","text":"Ted Cruz is one of the reasons why the GOP will never take back the Whitehouse!","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153581839945837?comment_id=10153582114095837","user":{"name":"Craig Steiger","id":"10202674912887568"},"likes":7},{"id":"10153581839945837_10153582144515837","text":"Both Super Trolls","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153581839945837?comment_id=10153582144515837","user":{"name":"Jane Boles","id":"411374282399901"},"likes":0},{"id":"10153581839945837_10153582836835837","text":"Picking up the #Texas #CultureOfCorruption endorsements he needs to win the #GOP nomination.","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153581839945837?comment_id=10153582836835837","user":{"name":"William Loney","id":"391627554312649"},"likes":0},{"id":"10153581839945837_10153583047105837","text":"Y'all Cruz ain't going nowhere.

Lerner was the director of the Exempt Organizations Unit of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and a central figure in the 2013 IRS targeting controversy.\n\nIn a letter to congressional committees probing the allegations that Lerner knowingly presided over the improper targeting of conservative organizations such as the Tea Party, the DOJ found no evidence that any IRS official acted based on political, discriminatory, corrupt, or other inappropriate motives that would support a criminal prosecution.\n\nHowever, a congressional investigation, launched in May 2013, uncovered substantial evidence of mismanagement, poor judgment and institutional inertia, with the IRS harming or harassing applicants affiliated with the Tea Party or similar groups. Even politically conservative employees at the IRS were critical of Lerner's leadership and management style.\n\nAs a result of the Department of Justice's failure to prosecute, Americans' faith in government and in the IRS in particular, has been greatly eroded by an Administration that when confronted with instances of misconduct appears complicit in shielding those involved from responsibility. Giving Lois Lerner and the IRS a free pass only reinforces the idea that government officials are above the law and that there is no consequence for wrongdoing.\n\nGiven the outcome of this investigation, can we really expect the Department of Justice to prosecute Hillary Clinton if she is found guilty of breaking the law by knowingly sending and receiving classified emails over a private network. There is little doubt President Obama would like his legacy to be clean of any controversy. Congressman Paul Ryan, head of the Ways and Means Committee, called the outcome predictable.","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153577023630837?comment_id=10153577129570837","user":{"name":"John Lemandri","id":"760045470709704"},"likes":0},{"id":"10153577023630837_10153577582885837","text":"Please get real!!

Facing not a foreign foe, but the sinister evil of seditious tyranny enveloping the halls of government. This foe is no less destructive to Democracy here and the world as a whole than any threat ever faced. We`ve lost many of the battles so far brandished by the shadow forces that lurk behind the scene, wielding powerful weapons of corruption and deceit. As we stand on the Brink All is not lost.\nWe have stood here before, again and again, but have rallied to the cause, Our Cause, against dark forces attempting to enslave the masses, from breaking the chains of servitude to restore the natural balance of our government, Of the people, For the people, and By the people. We gather our great strength, standing on the backs of our ancestral giants who stood as we do today on the Brink.\nWashington, stood there, burning, to forge this noble government on the frigged shores that Christmas day, He didn’t rally the troops with the cry, \"for the Aristocrats\" as he boarded the boats, Flag waving, to face the enemy but cried \"Liberty for ALL”. When Francis Scott key wrote his famous poem as we stood on the brink in 1812 for the Defense of Fort Mc'Henry he wrote \"And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave /// O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!\" he wasn’t writing about a land oppressed by the rich. When Lincoln stood on the brink of disaster at Gettysburg, he immortalized the cause, on the field covered in blood with the creed from OUR Constitution, of a Government, \"Of the People, for the People, By the People, should NOT Perish from\nthis Earth!\" He was not calling on the thousand who perished in defense of this nation so the Elite Few, would prosper or control the government. When your Fathers and Mothers across this Nation, found themselves standing on the Brink, answered the call, Storming and Dying on the beaches of Normandy, did so that our Democracy would still bloom, giving all her citizens an Equal chance, Equal Justice and Equal voice in Our Government, They did not rally on those bloody sands crying, For the Kochs, the Waltons, or the Rothschilds, But cried en mass, For our country, For our People, For our friends and neighbors, for our families, this, and only this, is what our Forefathers sacrificed so much for! When the towers fell and we stood again on the Brink, Our Sons and Daughters took up the flag fighting to save democracy, Not for the Mega Rich to hoard more and more of Americas prosperity, earned by all who worked so hard, But for all Americans. Will we forsake them now, as we stand again on the Brink, of loosing Our Democracy Of The People? Or, will We Rally to the defense of Our Nation, and restore our sacred creed by removing the stain of sedition represented in the abomination of Citizens United, That subverts, All that Americans Stand for?\nNow is the time to pick the side of History you want to be remembered for. Do you hear the cries of the obressed?\nI, As a Proud American, stand with the people, All the people, and will come to answer the call,\nRestoring Common sense, Decency, Fairness and Equal Justice for all and not for the selfish Few.\nVOTE IN EVERY ELECTION.\nPROSECUTE ALL VOTER SUPPRESSION AND FRAUD. \nVOTE PROGRESSIVE BLUE! \n☆ PRESIDENT SANDERS ☆ \nLET'S TRY INTEGRITY FOR A CHANGE","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153572161370837?comment_id=10153572413290837","user":{"name":"David Quinlan","id":"10152094661495488"},"likes":0},{"id":"10153572161370837_10153572738385837","text":"Socialism doesn't work !","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153572161370837?comment_id=10153572738385837","user":{"name":"Randy Hale","id":"783723671664782"},"likes":1},{"id":"10153571720660837_10153571805310837","text":"https://m.facebook.com/events/598920056915214?view=permalink&id=598920063581880","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153571720660837?comment_id=10153571805310837","user":{"name":"MartinDavid Miller","id":"10152065726462705"},"likes":0},{"id":"10153571720660837_10153571805470837","text":"Texas Patriot missing","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153571720660837?comment_id=10153571805470837","user":{"name":"MartinDavid Miller","id":"10152065726462705"},"likes":0},{"id":"124434790836:10153571374145837:10101331650483551_10153572659055837","text":"Nisha Patel","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153571374145837?comment_id=10153572659055837","user":{"name":"Robin Liles Callan","id":"10152193072633299"},"likes":1},{"id":"124434790836:10153571374145837:10101331650483551_10153572874185837","text":"Thanks Robin Liles Callan!","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153571374145837?comment_id=10153572874185837","user":{"name":"Nisha Patel","id":"10205476179081951"},"likes":1},{"id":"10153571264085837_10153571330610837","text":"No more death penalties ...

I support Hillary Clinton for her many accomplishments including getting 12 million children insured under the Children's Health Insurance Program, promoting peace around the world including negotiating a cease fire between Israel and Hamas in 2012, starting the talks on the Iran nuclear deal, fighting for women's rights here and across the world for over twenty years including her famous speech in Beijing and countless other reasons.  She is someone I trust to fight hard championing for me and all Americans, working hard to actually get things done.  Not all lofty goals can be accomplished in one sweeping move but you can best believe she has a game plan and strategy to keep chipping away at achieving them where she can and pushing others to get there when they won't.  Aside from all of the obvious reasons...I do fight for her for my grandmother who is no longer here but loved her, my mom and all the women who came before me that haven't lived to see the day that they are just as smart, capable and equal as any of our finest men to hold the office of the Presidency.  I think about that 90 something year old woman in a wheel chair, wrapped in blankets sitting on the sidewalk with a sign propped against her chest promoting Hillary at the first rally I held in Houston in 2008.  She cried saying she never thought she would see the day and hoped she lived long enough to see it realized.  She's likely no longer with us.  But there are 90 somethings and 9 year olds feeling the same way for this election and we will NOT let them down.  I hope you all will join me and others on this journey to elect the most qualified person in this race to not only be President but get stuff done!","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153569762685837?comment_id=10153569963585837","user":{"name":"Kim Frederick","id":"10152928500684187"},"likes":26},{"id":"10153569762685837_10153569975320837","text":"Awesome and impressive list of dedicated supporters!","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153569762685837?comment_id=10153569975320837","user":{"name":"Timothy Bolden","id":"763220943798031"},"likes":9},{"id":"10153569762685837_10153569980525837","text":"yeah, but how have texas democrats been working out","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153569762685837?comment_id=10153569980525837","user":{"name":"Justin Freebourn","id":"10104711958239794"},"likes":9},{"id":"10153569762685837_10153569981580837","text":"HRC for President!!!

That has been true since at least 1980 with the election of Ronald Reagan\n\n5) American families are hurting financially and the GOP is largely to blame for the mess we are in now.  For decades they have told us if we just give the rich more tax cuts, then they will have more money to pump into the economy.  But that has never happened.  They took their tax cuts to gamble in the stock market and left main street Americans hanging out to dry.\n\n6) Among the Democratic candidates, none brings the depth and breadth of experience on the national AND international stage that Mrs Clinton brings to the table starting on Day One.\n\nI can go on and on, but these are some of the key points (without getting into the specific policy differences proposed by the candidates on both sides of the aisle during this election cycle).","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153569782570837?comment_id=10153569848770837","user":{"name":"Brian Bowen","id":"1006907752658462"},"likes":3},{"id":"10153569782570837_10153569849385837","text":"Are they going to give equal time to the Democrats?

Now, Obama is considering litigating all who do oppose his climate change fanaticism. In the 70s they said we were going to have an ice age. In the 90s they said we were going to heat up and the seas would rise. Now they are saying we are have man made climate change. Now they are saying CO2 is bad. CO2 is what the plants need to grow. More plants, warmer weather and more water means we can feed the estimated 10 billion people on earth at the end of the century. We have natural cyclical climate change. The sun and the moon have more to do with it than man. Yes, we can use the cleanest of energies and the cleanest methods of burning fossil fuels but we cannot stop using fossil fuels until we have a cheap, abundant and efficient alternative fuel--unless we want to lower the standard of living all over the world. Bernie, Clinton and Obama's way will destroy our economy. I am with Margaret Thatcher , climate change is a good way to force socialism on the world. There is a better way to address polution than beggaring ourselves while third world nations continue to use fossil fuels. Bernie is mistaken, the existential threat to America and the world is Radical Islam and their barbaric supremacist theology. I think common sense and reality have left the Progressives.

A retired State Department employee, who asked not to be identified, confirmed this week that he spoke with the family of the girl and filed a report with his superiors. Clinton admitted having sex with the girl, but claimed it was consensual.\nIn an interview with Capitol Hill Blue, the retired State Department employee said he believed the story Miss Wellstone, the young English woman who said Clinton raped her in 1969. ''There was no doubt in my mind that this young woman had suffered severe emotional trauma,'' he said. ''But we were under tremendous pressure to avoid the embarrassment of having a Rhodes Scholar charged with rape. I filed a report with my superiors and that was the last I heard of it.'' Miss Wellstone, who is now married and lives near London, confirmed the incident when contacted this week, but refused to discuss the matter further. She said she would not go public with further details of the attack. In his book, Unlimited Access, former FBI agent Gary Aldrich reported that Clinton left Oxford University for a \"European Tour\" in 1969 and was told by University officials that he was no longer welcome there. Aldrich said Clinton's academic record at Oxford was lackluster. Clinton later accepted a scholarship for Yale Law School and did not complete his studies at Oxford. The State Department official who investigated the incident said Clinton's interests appeared to be drinking, drugs and sex, not studies. \"I came away from the incident with the clear impression that this was a young man who was there to party, not study,\" he said. Oxford officials, contacted last week, refused comment. The State Department also refused to comment on the incident.\"\n\nEducate yourself Read about this, and every one of his crimes against women. \n\nNew book: Unlikeable: The problem with Hillary,  &\n\nNEW BOOK:  The Clintons’ War on Women - in stores now.

In my family's case, we have sadly stopped going to movie theatres. Not only do I not want my purse searched, but I also don't want my kids to be trapped in case some nutso has one of the millions of guns easily available to him and decides to start shooting. I am also much warier these days if I go to the mall. Sadly, thanks to the obssessive gun culture in this state and country, I am often looking over my shoulder and much more aware of people around me. To allow guns in college campus buildings is not only stupid, it's dangerous. For the students. They are under enough pressure already, between academics, experimenting and socializing and many of them being away from home for the first time. If you think you'll be safer with guns in the dorm, you are sadly mistaken. The tragedy is that a tragedy will likely have to occur to make the pro-campus carry people see reason. This is NOT about the second amendment. This is about understanding that college students don't think reasonably all the time, don't make sound decisions all the time and don't show great judgment all the time. If you don't understand that, then shame on you.  My child's right to a safe college experience trumps your right to pack heat.

Senator Sanders introduced a bill to prohibit offshore drilling in 2010. He has been vocal in his opposition to Citizens United and McCutcheon. He is for states requiring labeling regarding GMO's, increasing infrastructure spending, voted to expand Social Security benefits, introduced a bill to break up the BIG BANKS,  is a proponnet of marriage equality and pay equality. He wants to stop fracking, is a friend to Labor and for $15, and importantly against TPP. He's voted against NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China, ending Glass Steagall, the Iraq War,  the Patriot Act, the Bank Bailout and Keystone XL. We've had corporate presidents for over thirty years. Bill Clinton, ended Glass Steagall, signed NAFTA into law, Obama, wants to fast track TPP free trade agreement, over the objections of most Democrats in congress. Senator Sanders is the hardest working Senator in the Senate, his reward, more knowledge than most. His record shows he is for the middle class. It is critical we have a people's president, with 33% of jobs now done by Americans being done by technology in ten short years, hardest hit, white collar positions. Add to that number the jobs lost from TPP and the line of free trade agreements waiting in line to be passed or still being negotiated, we could see unemployment of over 30%. During the height of the Great Depression unemployment, 28-29%.

Any commission will feel pressure to show vouchers decrease costs- which they'll use TPPF to prove- and in the process need to review the overall budget. This should lead to a recommendation to increase funds for these programs at the expense to schools. We know that won't fly completely which is why they'll need to also raise educational funds overall. Either we'll see some funding for public schools restored as a consequence of trying to push out these programs, or we'll see a dead bill hit the house as Tea party folks balk at the notion they must raise government spending for something.

Ask the almost 15,000 Denton voters who voted for our fracking ban, and they’ll tell you this new plan is a gas-soaked Trojan-Horse-style false ‘gift’ delivered to us by the same folks at Denton City Hall who repealed our democratically-decided fracking ban (a repeal vote conducted without even posting it as an agenda item beforehand as required by the Texas Open Meetings Act), and weakened our already weak gas well ordinance by allowing minimal “reverse setback” distances between new residential developments and gas wells as close as 250 feet.\nWhat’s so abhorrent to us about this so-called “Renewable Denton” plan is that it’s being advertised on its slick new website in a deceptive manner that downplays its most substantial component: the construction of two huge and hugely costly gas-powered electric plants in city limits (plants that enable our city's dangerous addiction to dangerous industrial activity in residential zones and create a new local market for compressed natural gas, the production, transportation, and storage of which is highly controversial and incredibly dangerous), wrapped up in the pretty window dressing of an admirable call for an increase in wind & solar and a decreased reliance on coal. That is why our two best councilmembers, Keely Briggs and Kathleen Wazny (the only 2 women on Denton city council, who are routinely shut out of our city council’s Old Boys' Club, and who happen to be on opposite sides of the political spectrum but find themselves frequently united on municipal matters, particularly when it comes to advocating for democracy and transparency in our city government and fighting corruption) boycotted the recent \"unveiling ceremony\" for this new utilities plan and have been speaking out against it on behalf of the citizens they swore to represent, the same citizens who OWN this public utility and are required to vote on any changes in utility policy.\n\nR.e. Denton’s utility system itself, Denton's city charter states that Denton Municipal Utilities (DME) is a publicly-owned utility owned by and accountable to Denton voters. But with no known staff outside of City Hall, DME is commonly known as a slush fund for Denton City Hall (our checks are even made out to the city of Denton rather than to DME), making this latest news just the most recent ugly chapter in DME’s shady history..\n\nMayor Watts, in defense of the new plan’s costly expansion of gas pollution and infrastructure, claims that an increase in wind and solar requires the new gas-powered plants as ‘back up’ energy for cloudy and windy days. But he is wrong; there’s no reason for us to construct these expensive and dangerous new gas power plants when we can follow in the footsteps of model wind and solar-powered U.S. cities and contract with wind and solar farms for back-up energy to serve the same purpose. 100% renewable energy works in other cities and it could work in Denton too. It is these model cities that we should be turning to for support, not to the fracking companies, who are only out for themselves, and are increasingly desperate to create new ways to please nervous investors, pay off their debts, and combat the dropping price of gas.\n\nWe the people of Denton, on the other hand, who own DME and who voted for a fracking ban, demand a 100% renewable energy plan that not only divests from coal but also breaks our city government’s habit of selling their souls, our health, and our democracy to the natural gas industry. But Denton’s unelected city management, who are unaccountable to voters, has other plans, as do their favorite councilmembers, who are more interested in furthering their own political and business interests than in representing their constituents. No surprise, considering that these are the same folks who led the movement to surreptitiously (and, many of us believe, illegally) repeal our fracking ban, and then approved an irresponsibly weak new gas well ordinance. These same folks are now trying to sell us a costly and gas-soaked new utilities plan with some additional wind and solar tacked on so they can call it “green,” and they’re apparently trying to sell it to the Texas Tribune too.\n\nThey’re selling alright, but the people of Denton aren’t buying it.","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153548179045837?comment_id=10153552653870837","user":{"name":"Deborah Needleman Armintor","id":"1029034677110853"},"likes":0},{"id":"10153548089130837_10153548688865837","text":"Really?","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153548089130837?comment_id=10153548688865837","user":{"name":"Carolyn Bruton","id":"10201982186141188"},"likes":0},{"id":"10153548089130837_10153548689410837","text":"More to the story...","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153548089130837?comment_id=10153548689410837","user":{"name":"Carolyn Bruton","id":"10201982186141188"},"likes":0},{"id":"10153547532760837_10153547728195837","text":"Does our money violate the Constitution?","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153547532760837?comment_id=10153547728195837","user":{"name":"Brent Raschke","id":"10204075321618032"},"likes":4},{"id":"10153547532760837_10153547734165837","text":"Does the sticker enhance the performance of the police in their public duties?","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153547532760837?comment_id=10153547734165837","user":{"name":"Daniel Miller","id":"10154269365905063"},"likes":9},{"id":"10153547532760837_10153547740120837","text":"I guess my folding money is unconstitutional.","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153547532760837?comment_id=10153547740120837","user":{"name":"Charles Anthony Siller","id":"395283013996689"},"likes":1},{"id":"10153547532760837_10153547741840837","text":"Maybe it was taggers.","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153547532760837?comment_id=10153547741840837","user":{"name":"Chris Heston","id":"10203614427460822"},"likes":0},{"id":"10153547532760837_10153547744185837","text":"Grabs popcorn...","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153547532760837?comment_id=10153547744185837","user":{"name":"Layton Sumpter","id":"10102436935488780"},"likes":7},{"id":"10153547532760837_10153547747490837","text":"don't bother questioning it. it's Texas.

While you may abort in one state at a given gestation week, in another that same abortion would indeed be illegal and thus murder, as Roe v Wade decision upheld the rights of the states to legislate the protection of the unborn child.  The Court held that, in regard to abortions during the first trimester, the decision must be left to the judgment of the pregnant woman’s doctor. In regard to second trimester pregnancies, states may promote their interests in the mother’s health by regulating abortion procedures related to the health of the mother.  So the footnotes on the link below that say those are unconstitutional are simply void of legal fact.  The Court decided otherwise, which is why you see states indeed determining when in the gestation abortion will be called murder.  It is all killing a life, but it is just legal to kill up to a given week of gestation. Based on some comments here, I'd think many would be surprised at this.  This is why there is no state regulating before 20 weeks.  It would be today unconstitutional, and thus the fight is still about the protection of that child before viability, because it is the responsibility of the mother (as a call for humanity) to protect the child at all stages of development, not just when it can survive without her.  \nhttp://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_OAL.pdf","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153546091145837?comment_id=10153549134940837","user":{"name":"Randy Lawrence","id":"10153243501256527"},"likes":0},{"id":"10153546091145837_10153549237720837","text":"And all those that needed other types of medical attention - how far do they have to travel now.

And, sadly, there are none. Your churches are void of sinners being saved because of your bigotry. \nThe churches sit closed and self-serving. In a catastrophic event you are nowhere to be seen or heard. In case you haven't heard, that's your job. That's what a true church should be all about, not collecting tithes, buying jets, building cathedrals, etc. How about standing up for changing laws to protect and save our innocents from abuse and neglect. Right now Child Protective Services leaves them in harm's way, gives confidentiality to the abusers, their punishment is parenting and DUI classes while the child is still in their care. How do you become a parent in 6 months? \nThese abusers lie about their psychopathic behavior and CPS believes them. Witnesses are not   contacted and the child's health and welfare ignored. The terror continues and escalates till death frees them from their tormentors. They should be freed by churchgoers, not death. \nTruth? Churchgoers are good for nothing but warming a bench.","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153541924660837?comment_id=10153544182390837","user":{"name":"Susan Lerma","id":"1430422943927591"},"likes":0},{"id":"10153541840030837_10153542978515837","text":"It's their funeral.","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153541840030837?comment_id=10153542978515837","user":{"name":"Adam Cahnman","id":"10154056743285263"},"likes":0},{"id":"10153541830435837_10153541837120837","text":"Get a backbone Judge...14th Amendment right; TX govt. acting like KY county clerk...","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153541830435837?comment_id=10153541837120837","user":{"name":"Neil Moyer","id":"655651464472491"},"likes":8},{"id":"10153541830435837_10153541857070837","text":"The state attorney corporal is playing to an issue while children wait......","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153541830435837?comment_id=10153541857070837","user":{"name":"Marty Jamieson","id":"4270518299120"},"likes":2},{"id":"10153541830435837_10153541951655837","text":"No matter where the parents are from, if you are born in the USA, you are an USA CITIZEN, NO MATTER WHAT...case closed people!!!!!","permalink":"https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/posts/10153541830435837?comment_id=10153541951655837","user":{"name":"Tim Aparicio","id":"819210121504879"},"likes":4},{"id":"10153541830435837_10153542304785837","text":"The adults do not have legal ID.
