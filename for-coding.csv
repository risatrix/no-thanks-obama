"The Supreme Court just announced it will decide the biggest abortion case in more than a decade--whether a Texas law that is set to close more than half of the state's remaining abortion clinics is unconstitutional.

But there's more at stake beyond Texas: Other states like Louisiana and Oklahoma quickly copied the law and used it to shut off access to reproductive care. When millions of Americans spoke up about how Obamacare improved their lives, the law was upheld--twice. As Americans we REFUSE to go back to the days when reproductive freedom and access were a privilege for a select few.",""

"No doubt this will set off a tirade of ugly nasty comments but have to say it is interesting to read some of these comments. I personally know a woman who claims to be a devout ""Christian."" You know, the one that sits in a pew every Sunday. She also claims to be a devout Republican. She also had an abortion. Did you read that, she had an abortion! Her reputation and her career meant more to her. God forbid if anyone found out she was pregnant. Worse yet, destroy her career. No, she wasn't going to have that. And yet she rallies against other woman seeking to terminate a pregnancy. Often wonder how many more are like her out there. My guess, quite a few. Such hypocrites.",""

"Dallas, Plano, and other major city leaders, working with the LGBT community better get ready for a sleazy intellectually dishonest attack on non-discrimination ordinances that is surely coming from Republican politicians and fundamentalist Christians.  And you better figure out how to rebut the arguments that worked in Houston.  

These hateful groups see an opening to repeal all protections against the LGBT community and they're not going to stop until they're beaten.  They have a template that worked.  So Kleinman and his allies better develop a sophisticated and well funded plan to beat these bigots.  I wouldn't be waiting around because they are busy planning a massive attack to repeal all LGBT protections throughout the Slaves States and the Red States by stigmatizing and demonizing transgender people.",""

Haven't they paid their debt to society ? I personally was discriminated against because of the college football team I liked. Speaking of college, should people without diplomas be discriminated against compared to people that have them? What about people that have a hard time getting up early? They still need jobs too. We need to do some serious work here people.",""
